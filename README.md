## About this Project
travel app using:      
-Firestore Database.      
-google_maps_flutter.   
-geolocator.   
-geocoding.     


## Functionalities   
-current location.      
-bookmarks for places visited.      
-save visited places in database.   
-list of places visited.       
-exclude visited places from the list.  


## Difficulties
-because the course is old and the frequent updates of Flutter many functionalities and syntax have changed, so I fixed it by searching one by one.   
This challenge sure made me improve my skills! lol    
In the end it was pretty cool!
